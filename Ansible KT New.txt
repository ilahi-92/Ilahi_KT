Ansible KT New

Master :

ssh-keygen

Client : 

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no

sudo systemctl restart sshd


Master :

cd ~/.ssh

ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub ec2-user@34.234.63.42  (ec2-user@client)


1. sudo yum install ansible

create file with any name : e.g my_inventory

2. vi my_inventory

[my_group]
54.226.68.93

Test

ansible -i my_inventory -m ping my_group

===========================================================

Install nginx on remote host :

---
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: my_group
  tasks:
    - name: Update package cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present


ansible-playbook -i my_inventory my_playbook.yml

========================================================

above will faile becuase apt is not for redhat and al2 linux linux distro

To make your Ansible playbook more cross-distribution compatible, you can use Ansible's package module to handle package management in a distribution-agnostic way. Here's how you can modify your playbook to use the package module:


---
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the package manager cache is up-to-date
      package:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: latest
      with_items:
        - nginx  # Name of the package you want to install
      become: yes  # This ensures the task is run with sudo privileges

ansible-playbook -i my_inventory my_playbook.yml
==============================================

remote host : 

sudo systemctl status nginx


sudo systemctl start nginx

sudo systemctl enable nginx

sudo vi /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html   (modfiy if requried)

test : paste the ip in browser it wil show nginx page

============================================================================




very very important :

if you have launched instance without the key pair then in client machine

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_confg - passwordauthenticaion yes

----- connection method - ec2 connect --- becaseu you dont have key to login from puty

-----------------------------------------------------------------

if you have launched instance with the key pair then - you can connect it from putty 

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_confg - pubkeyauthenticanon yes

==== connection method - ssl client == or putty
