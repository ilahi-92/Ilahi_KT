Jenkins backup and restore to s3

reason

data protection - protect agains data loss - software or hardware failure

disastary recory - easiy restore

upgrade or migration 

Step 1 : change the password in order to check and verify later

commands

sudo systemctl stop jenkins

systemctl status jenkins

take the backup of jenkins home directory 

var/lib/jenkins

tar -zcvf jenkins-backup.tar.gz /var/lib/jenkins

now we have tar.gz and we have to take the backup to s3 bucket.

aws s3 cp jenkins-backup.tar.gz s3://shaik.ilahi/jenkins-backup.tar.gz 

we need to proivde role this machine.

iam - roles - aws service - ec2 - policy s3 - full acess - role name 

ec2 - action - security - modify - attach iam role

and run the command again 

check in s3 now ....

you will have the backup....

destroy the machine.....

launch ec2 instance name it as restore : 


now in user data we have to give jenkins installation script

===============================================

new instnce --

launch jenkins - it will ask for unlock jenkins password 

dont give the password - go back to the new machine and restore from s3

commands

attach iam role : - s3 full access : 

systemctl stop jenkins

restore

aws s3 cp s3://shaik.ilahi/jenkins-backup.tar.gz jenkins-backup.tar.gz

tar is now available

sudo rm  -rf /var/lib/jenkins

sudo tar -zxvf jenkins-backup.tar.gz -C /

start the jenkins :

systemctl start jenkins

refresh jenkins url : it will ask for admin credetials :

use credentials from previous server...
